I wrote a booking system for the local concert society, back in '06 or so. This
is the fruits of that labor. I'm putting it in source control mostly because
I don't want to keep it around anymore but I'm probably still on the hook if
something goes wrong with it.

That being said, it's in PHP so obviously something *will* go wrong with it.

If you're an employer, you're not allowed to judge me on this code =)
